<h1>Developing with passion</h1>
<body>After finishing my bachelor's in Sinology I realized the career of a Mandarin Chinese interpreter is not for me, as it did not allow for much artistic freedom and creativity. Luckily a friend of mine recommended that I should learn programming and it just clicked. I love making iOS apps and being a fan of Apple's ecosystem I design apps according to the criteria of their "magic".<br>  Below you can find my most recent projects, with the topmost soon being my first AppStore release, currently undergoing TestFlight beta.</body><br>
<h2>Lilu by Gosia</h2>
<body>Lilu is a fashion catalog that uses an external Content Management System and a simple design that makes it very easy to navigate and browse.</body>

<h5>Using: SwiftUI, API calls, MapKit</h5>

<h2>HanziShifu</h2>
<body>HanziShifu is a placeholder name for my app that aims at teaching how to write Chinese characters. It uses different iOS frameworks and has different modes, which allow the user to learn (by drawing line by line), practice (by drawing without helper dots) and add new characters (I'm using Python for this step).
